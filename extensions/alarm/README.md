# Alarm Clock

Creates alarms and timers based on the provided text.

## Examples

- durations `15m`, `1h20m40s`
- specific times `4:30pm`, `16:30`
- labels `leave for dentist next friday at noon`

## Preferences

### Use alert box instead of notification banner (default: `true`)

If the system has a Focus enabled, notifications may be ignored but alert boxes will still show up.
